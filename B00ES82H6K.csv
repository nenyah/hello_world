B00ES82H6K,"September 29, 2014",5,10.5,4E, Titanium/Black/Red,"I used the Gel Nimbus 15s to train for a marathon over the summer.  A month from race day, they were getting worn down, so I bought the 16s to replace them.Compared to the 15, the Gel Nimbus 16 is less cushy, and has a touch more support.  Definitely still a neutral shoe.  Overall I think it's a bit more comfortable to run in, the old shoes could get kind of ponderous and squishy.  I would say it's like taking the soft touring tires off a Buick and putting tires with firmer sidewalls on.  Same basic ride, but the car feels more planted with more control.I did a ten miler right out of the gate in these shoes, and my knees, legs, and feet felt great after.  If you liked the 15s, I suspect you'd like these.  I wouldn't suggest them to people who buy expensive running shoes to just walk around in, but I would think most runners who liked the old shoes would love these.",Asics hits another home run.

When I received them, they came in a bag which obviously did not protect the box very well. Despite this fact the shoes were in 100% intact.

The pair I replaced about killed my feet and lower legs as the soles were not cushioned enough. Anyway, I had purchased a pair of the Gel Nimbus 13 shoes a few years ago which were great for standing on concrete, and for distance running for that matter, so after the failure with ""the other pair of Asics"", I searched Amazon for the Gel Nimbus 13's and came up with these Gel Nimbus 16's. These have been GREAT! I have a lot less discomfort in my feet and lower legs with prolonged standing on concrete at work.

B00ES82H6K,"July 14, 2015",4,7,D(M), White/Black/Royal,"This review actually starts with my 4 year experience using the Nimbus 11 as my secondary running shoe. I bought those in my oft-selected 13-D size. (I'm over 6'2"". 225 lbs.) Although listed as neutral shoes, they felt a lot like stability shoes with good support and decent cushioning. (Not up to something like New Balance 993, but real good for the 50% off deal that I got for them at a mall store.)  In this size, they felt a skosh snug, but not uncomfortably so.Fast forward 4 years later: On a whim, I try on a pair of Nimbus 16's in 13-2E- the wider size definitely fit better. For people blind buying this, I'd suggest ordering the next size wider as that worked out better for me. Anyway, store was charging full sticker price, I check Amazon to see a 13-2E available (in the same White/Royal Blue combo as my Nimbus 11) at ~ 30% less price.These have the same likes as my Nimbus 11 (still have those, still holding up). Shoes were delivered ahead of schedule, I would gladly order another pair through Amazon.PS- For some reason, heading is showing that I bought a size 7D. I'll positively state here that I bought a 13-2E size.I'm barely past the break in period, but so far these have been a better fit than my original N11.",Next Wider Size Fit Better

I have been running in NB shoes for the last decade as they always fit my foot the best.  Have been looking at the Nimbus for a while and decided to give them a try this year.  LOVE the Shoe!!!  Great fit, good seem like a well made shoe.  Its only been a few weeks, so I will need to see how they hold up.  If they do hold up, this will be my go to shoe in the future.Sizing:The fit is spot on for the listed size.  I wear a 10.5 D shoe and ordered both the 10.5 and 11 D size to try out.  The 10.5 fit well and would be the right size for walking and general use.  My toe had about 1/4 inch of room before hitting the end of the toe box.  Moving up to the 11 and it gave me a thumbs width worth of room between my toe and the end of the shoe.So if you like a minimal gap at the end of your shoe, get the size of your daily work shoe.  If you need a bit more room, I would go up a 1/2 size.Shoe is very neutral feeling. Going a 1/2 up though required the use of the lock lacing holes of the shoe to lock my foot in.  The 1/2 size is a bit more ""floaty"" in the foot feel compared to the 10.5 (my normal shoe size) but after the laces are tightened up, the fit and feel during a run is great.  Good response with a very cushioned feel.Best road training shoe I have owned.",Great cushing and neutral support - add 1/2 size up if you want a finger width space at end of shoe
B00ES82H6K,"September 19, 2015",5,14,D(M), White/Black/Royal,These shoes are the best all around shoes I've ever had for walking all day and running with regards to comfort and quality.  I just recently started buying more expensive shoes like these and I find that the benefits of a good shoe outweigh the cost.  I also wear Mizuno Waverider shoes and Hoka Roku shoes.  The Mizunos are lighter and better looking and the Hokas have a great deal more absorption but these Asics do everything very well.

Running in my old Adidas shoes was painful after a few minutes, so I looked for soft-sole shoes to reduce the impact on my knees and I stumbled on these Asics. The change was pretty dramatic. A day later I could run three times as much without pain. I even play basketball in these now. They're not too soft if you just press down on the sole with your hand to test it. You really have to wear them and run in them to see how well they absorb the shock. Unlike other shoes, these get softer the harder you step on them. A year later, I am very satisfied with them and would recommend without a doubt. They're still holding together very well (and they get stepped on all the time during basketball).",These shoes are awesome

I put them on and immediately ran a 5k. The difference between these and my old shoes (which were, admittedly, probably 10 years old) was like night and day.

I have several pairs of Nimbus shoes that I rotate and these are one of them. They are extremely comfortable and ""cushiony"" and good for long runs.

I have just received these shoes today and have been wearing them around the house to break in. The length of the shoe is true to size but the shoe is very tight. I really loosened the laces and it feels somewhat better. although the size that I ordered is the identical size to the previous 3 pairs of Asics that I absolutely wore out, I suspect that either these shoes are a little narrow or they just need to be broken in more. The padding on the bottom may need time to mold better to my foot or compress. Maybe that will give me more room but right now they are too tight particularly on the top of my feet.

I've only been on one run with these so this is a little early to evaluate i think.. I've always loved the Nimbus line.. For years in the beginning i bought the GT's. But than one day at the running store the girl told me i should use the Nimbus.. I have a pretty high arch.. First off these are a much firmer riding shoe.. not the running on a cloud i used to feel with them.. I also experienced right heel  slippage .. i noticed my sock was sliding down into my shoe..holy geez i'm thinking i've never had this happen with these shoes before.. but after 3 miles it seem to stop.. so maybe my foot just needed to fit in i guess i would say.. the toe area is a little more roomier also..

B00ES82H6K,"March 11, 2015",5,13,2E, White/Black/Royal,"I've been a Nike fan for years and i've owned many pairs and styles.  I've found Nike shoes to be a little narrow for my size feet and i'd end up buying a larger size shoe to make them fit right.  Well I decided to try Asics shoes since they offered the larger widths in my size (2E and 4E) and that sounded good since i've worn shoes that were a little narrow for my wide feet for years.  I ordered my first pair of Asics and they were the Gel-Flux model and I ordered them in the 4E width to see how they would fit and as expected I had plenty of room and if I tightened the strings up they fit fine (a little loose, but OK).  This model was a cheaper shoe than the Gel-Nimbus 16 and they were ok except for my vacation where I walked most of the day for 3 days straight at Universal Studios in Orlando, FL.  The third day my feet started to hurt and I didn't think it was the shoes just old age.  I got home and it hit me that maybe my feet would have held up better if i'd bought a more expensive shoe with a better cushioned sole.  Amazon sent me an email about men's shoes and the Asics Gel-Nimbus 16's were on sale and the listing talked about the Gel impregnated sole.  I thought i'd give them a try to see if I thought they would make my feet hold up better on extended walks like i'd gone on in Orlando.  I ordered a pair and I tried them on the first time yesterday.  I ordered these in the 2E size instead of the previous 4E and when I first put them on they felt a little snug, but they were brand new.  I had quite a bit of walking to do that day and just in case I took my spare pair of Asics Gel-Flux shoes that were well broken in along just in case my new Gen-Nimbus 16's hurt my feet.  What a pleasant surprise I had with the Asics Gel-Nimbus 16 shoes.  The more I walked in them the better they felt and I did a good bit of walking the first day in a brand new pair of shoes.  I usually switch the liner in my shoes to a gel liner and take out the original liner, but I didn't have a new liner to put in my new shoes so I thought i'd give them a try just as they came out of the box.  The Asics Gel-Nimbus 16's have a  Gel impregnated sole and I was amazed at how well they felt brand new not broken in.  I had to go back to the hospital today to see a family member and there was quite a bit of walking involved like the first day since you had to park quite a ways from the hospital and I wore my new Asics today which was day two  for my Gel-Nimbus 16's and they felt even better since they were softening up and breaking in and I was just amazed at how well they felt.  In fact I was so amazed and excited about these shoes that I ordered another pair from Amazon just like them so I can rotate them.  I have quite a few pairs of athletic shoes and most of them will be getting some closet time now after I discovered the Asics Gel-Nimbus 16's shoes.  I'd recommend these shoes to my friends based on my experiences of owning many different styles of athletic shoes in my life and this model Asics shoe is a very good comfortable shoe!","Asics Gel-Nimbus 16's, my new favorite running shoe!"

I went into a local shoe store and they recommended these shoes after videotaping my stride.  They are way more comfortable than the shoes I was running in ($30 sketchers) and I'm glad to say that the knee pain completely went away when I started running in them.  I also really noticed a difference when going down concrete stairwells.  In my old shoes, I used to clomp down like a herd of buffalo, but on these it's almost silent.Of course, everyone's feet are different, and my fiancee can't stand these shoes (even though we have the same size feet).  Definitely try these on before you order them online.  This is my second pair.  I was originally fitted for them at a local shoe shop, where they were around the same price.If you do pick these up, I'd recommend a different (shorter) pair of shoelaces.  Of course, I'd give that disclaimer for every shoe I've bought in the past 6 years.",Great for running

B00ES82H6K,"June 10, 2014",5,8,2E, White/Black/Royal,"On to my 4th pair of Nimbus, and as usual a great fit.  I knew my size and my usual 2E width and Asics makes them so consistently that I didn't have to try out a pair at an outlet before buying.  Also feel these are slightly lighter than my previous pair (Nimbus 13).  I use these for my weekly runs usually 6 - 10km and a couple of events a year and they are good for regular training and events.... I don't race enough to justify a separate pair of racers.  My feet has more tendency to roll outwards than inwards and these are definitely more suitable if you are a neutral to slight underpronator.  I would recommend 2E width if you see that your feet are bulging out of your current shoes at the sides (esp just behind the little toe)... the 2E widths are slightly wider and make a very comfortable fit.  If you want even wider, you'll have to go for 4E.  There are other colours for Nimbus 16 but for 2E, I believe Asics only makes 2E widths in this colour (for now at least).",Great shoe for neutral or slight underpronators

Love them. I have more of a flat foot, yet running is more of a sprint activity I do to prepare for ice hockey and these shoes are super in terms of support and being ""neutral."" I use one new pair to train on a treadmill, after six months I use them (and get a new training pair) for my work, of which I'm on my feet for long periods of time at a physically active indoors job. Glorious shoes. Asics makes a lot of different shoes (support-wise), so go to a local pro and describe what you're using them for and they'll look at your foot and tell you the best fit/make for you. I tried Kayano's first and that was way too much arch support for me. So let a pro tell you what's best for you before you buy any expensive shoe.",excellent shoe if this is the proper make for you.

I gave up serious running after getting plantar fasciitis a number of years ago.  That's when I switched from New Balance to Asics, specifically the Kayano, to get a shoe with more support.  I had about every version of Kayano from the 12's to the 19's, sometimes two of the same version.  I loved that line, until the 19's and what I saw of the 20's.  It seemed like they took a supportive cushion training shoe perfect for a heavier guy who ran occasionally to stay in shape , and took out all of the cushion and some of the support to make it a lighter race shoe for a 150 lbs. marathon guy.  I switched to the Nimbus line at the 15's and LOVED those shoes.  I was worried when I got these 16's that Asics was doing the same thing with the Nimbus line.  They seemed to have less padding around the tongue and collar, and the sole seemed stiff.  But after a few days to break them, they've been just as comfortable as the previous pair.  They're not as supportive as the Kayanos were, they seem to let your foot go where it wants when running, but the cushion is better.  My feet don't hurt after workouts.  I haven't run much in them, but jump training has felt great and I might start running more with all this cushion underneath.",Like a cloud

These shoes were smaller and more narrow then the Gel-Nimbus 14 of the same size, these were much stiffer, and less cushioning.The fact that these shoes are slightly smaller was not the main issue that I did not like these, it is the comfort level these provide, the stiffness, and shock absorption of these shoes fell way short of the Nimbus -14's.I will say these shoes felt very stable, and perhaps that's due to their stiffness.I would like to say I am impressed with the seller, fast shipping and free returns. It is too bad that Asics took a good model like the Gel-Nimbus and turned it into something as uncomfortable as these were.",Disappointing!!!!

I didn't listen. I bought these 1 week ahead of the NYC Marathon and ran with the new pair just about 10 miles before the big race... my experience:LOVED THEM. No issues at all, felt like running on a cloud. Would highly recommend these for neutral runners for any purpose including very long runs and marathons.Note on size: before these, I wore Asics ""Gel Kayano 19 Men's"" at size 10.5. I ordered these Nimbus at size 10.5 and 11 ""just in case"" and ended up returning the smaller pair. Not sure why 10.5 felt a bit tight. I preferred to avoid potential blisters by going with the larger pair. It was the right decision.",Bought it 1 week before NYC Marathon

B00ES82H6K,"February 24, 2015",3,9.5,4E, White/Black/Royal,Allright . I'm a big asics fan . I like alot of the stuff they do . Here's the thing I have a pair of ASICS Men's Gel-Nimbus 15 . Same specs everything (+PHF) so I thought that getting it in the newer model would be sure bet ... The way they redid the outer webbing makes the shoe a little uncomfortable . It crosses over the toebox in a way that doesn't work so much for me ... Over the year i have grown accustom to The PHF system . Though a little fragile is a must to help keep the toe dowm . This question is for you Asics of america : Why woul you take it out ? So older models have the PHF and this newer model does not ! Had I never owned a pair of Asics before this woul probably get five stars . But It's so hard to find a good fitting pair of shoes out the box ... When you do they go ahead and change the fit . Something asics is contantly doing . Being a 4E width I can't just go to my corner outlet store to try them on . They should have fit codes if they want to arround with the models so much .I found this pair a little expensive to not be getting the perfect fit . Comfort before looks !Still a great pair of shoes ...,"Asics rocks! Hmmm, not all the time !"

B00ES82H6K,"April 7, 2015",1,12,D(M), Island Blue / Lightning / Lime,"Update: After about a hundred miles of use, the shoes broke down. My understanding is that they are supposed to last 300+ miles. I would have expected better from asics. I have worn this line of shoes (in this size) for 5 years, and am extremely disappointed in the quality of this iteration (16s).I'm not sure I will buy shoes online again. I ended up with injuries that lasted several weeks. After speaking with a local running store, they advised against buying online. That was due to observations that they made based on shoes they sell versus what they had seen from others that bought online. Their only guess was that maybe shoes that weren't able to be sold in stores were sold online (not up to quality standards or something). They did say that the 16s did not sell when they had them in stock, but that the 17s were flying off the shelf, for what that's worth. Maybe it's just the model that wasn't quite right. I ended up with a different brand, but I wish I'd done my homework first.","Initially comfortable, quickly caused injuries"

I tried the various Brooks models that are so highly rated, but this shoe provided more cushioning and was overall more comfortable for me.  I tried on size 9 in the store but they were too large.  Unfortunately I could not find an 8.5 anywhere.  I ordered through Amazon and the package arrived in a timely manner.  The shoe is slightly bigger than anticipated.  I have owned ASICS in the past and have never had that problem.  They fit but not as anticipated thus the four star rating.  Otherwise they meet all my expectations in terms of comfort.  It is too early to talk about durability.  I don't know if the entire line of ASICS Gel-Nimbus shoes runs larger than other brands but my particular pair does.  Overall great shoe and good service from Amazon.  Love ASICS and will buy from them again.",Excellent Choice

That has worked very nicely so far.  I did have to go through a brief break in period where I only wore the shoes for an hour or two to start, but after a week, I'm now able to wear my shoes all day comfortably.

B00ES82H6K,"May 30, 2014",4,11,D(M), Black / Onyx / Orange,I have run on the Nimbus 15 for the past year and loved those shoes.  I run about 3 times per week about 3-4 miles at a time.  The Nimbus 16's are a little faster but dont give the same ultra-soft landing as the 15's did.Still overall a great shoe.,Lighter than Nimbus 15 but less cusioning
B00ES82H6K,"April 13, 2015",1,12,D(M), Island Blue / Lightning / Lime,"Switched to these shoes based on other reviews of these shoes. 4 long runs in and my toes still go numb after an hour of running.

If it doesn't the shoes are going in the garbage, very disappointing if I have to do that.",Toes go numb
B00ES82H6K,"August 3, 2014",4,10.5,D(M), Titanium/Black/Red,"I gave these Asics a four star rating because I haven't had them long enough to speak on the durability of them. The cushioning is definitely very good. The sole structure is a bit wider than the Nike's I've been wearing, making them very stable. They're also lighter than the Nike's by almost 2 ounces. Doesn't sound like much, but on a five mile run it's noticeable. The toe box is wide and comfortable, and the heel structure is nice and snug to prevent slipping up and down, wearing blisters. The gel sole is so soft that my legs got sore  the first time I wore them. Heel to toe height is closer to flat than I've worn before, taking a little bit of getting used to. I exercise on about 50% trail / 50% pavement. The Nimbus felt solid on both surfaces. If they prove to be durable, I would be very happy with these. I would recommend them to friends.",A Solid Performer

B00ES82H6K,"September 5, 2014",5,12,D(M), Titanium/Black/Red,"Although I liked the Asics Nimbus 15 alright, I was never totally pleased - a 4 star.  I believe I've worn every iteration of the Nimbus line and have been pleased, especially in the arch support area.  But some have been better than others.  In my mind, this is by far the best of the Nimbus' so far.The Nimbus 16 is a significant improvement in my opinion.  I've worn them now for 2 months for my daily run of 3 miles each day outside in various weather conditions.  I love them.Fit:  I wear a size 12 med and the fit on these is perfect.  I found the 16 to be a little sloppy and loose.  These fit true to a size 12.Support:  The support is where I find the 16 far superior to its predecessor.  Their is better ankle support and these shoes do not have any side roll - they provide excellent side support.  Also, I find the arch support far better and is perfect for my foot - I need some additional arch support.  The heel is very well cushioned and gives you a bit of a bounce when it strikes the pavement.  Also, the support for the ball of the foot is very good.  I do wear custom orthotics which are a huge benefit, but I also wore them with the old shoe.Weight:  I'm always a bit suspicious when I read a running shoe is even lighter than its predecessor.  I've found at times you give up support.  However, with the 16, I can't find any tradeoffs yet.  They feel practically weightless.Overall, this is a very comfortable running shoe that provides excellent all around foot support.  I am going to buy another pair if I can still find one so I will have a pair for future.  I like them that much.My only complaint is the pathetic insoles, but since all shoes suffer this problem, I didn't feel it fair to downgrade the rating.  And since I wear custom orthotics, it's not an issue anyway.",Even better than the Nimbus 15 - Improved support and lighter

What a difference.  These 860's were very comfortable on my feet, and they fit as I expected size 4E shoes should fit.  I would advise anyone else to not waste their time with these AISIC shoes.  Do not question customer reviews that say these shoes are narrower than expected.  They are much narrower.  Also, although I have PRIME, I was charged about $10 to cover cost of return by UPS, although website ad said FREE RETURNS.

B00ES82H6K,"March 31, 2015",1,9,D(M), Island Blue / Lightning / Lime,"First, I want to say I love the Gel Nimbus 16 shoe.  I have been running in them for a year now and will continue to run in them.  Second, I rarely write reviews.  I write them only to help others avoid potential pitfalls.  The issue I had with this shoe was that I received a shoe that was already worn down and/or defective even though I bought it ""New"".  Buyer, beware!  Buying a so called ""New"" shoe online is extremely risky.  You have no idea whether or not the shoe has already been worn or is defective until you actually start to use them risking injury.  Remember, a 30 day return policy is in place.  I know runners who can easily put 200 miles on a pair of shoes in 30 days and have them still look brand new.  Imagine if they returned them and the shoe was then sent back out to you who thinks they are new!I am an avid runner and triathlete who runs 25-30 miles per week.  After using this pair for just 2 or 3 outdoor runs, I experienced pain in both of my calves within just a few miles that never went away.  In 3 years of running, I have never experienced pain like this even in previous Gel Nimbus 16's I have been wearing for a year now.  Took 4 days off from running and tried again this time on a treadmill...same issue and now it was worse.  For grins, I decided to go to my local running store to try on the exact same shoe.  Immediately, I noticed the gel was hardened in this so called ""New"" shoe from Amazon when compared to a true New shoe from my local running store.  Ended up buying a true new pair of these from my local running store and the pain is gone.  Have taken them out on 3 runs now without pain.  Thankfully, I ditched these worn/defective ones before I experienced a more serious injury!","""New"" may not actually be ""New"""

I run 3.5 miles 3 to 4 days a week on a combination of asphalt and concrete. My feet never hurt during or after the run. You have seen many reviews claim it's like runnng on clouds, and i have to agree. My only issue with my Asics Nimbus 16's is the sole is wearing at a very fast rate. Like REALLY fast.I read most runners feel a good shoe will last them 200 to 300 miles. Yet, I only have 69 miles on these and the area where my feet land as i run is nearly worn past the rubber. No, i don't drag or scrape my feet as i run. And i also am not an over or under pronate runner, just an avarage male looking for a shoe that will last. I would say that if i were running on a treadmill they would probably last the 300 miles. Unfortunatly its not happening for me and how i run.","Would be 5 stars, but..."

B00ES82H6K,"September 25, 2015",5,12,D(M), Black / Onyx / Orange,"Whether you run once a week or run 10 miles a day, Asics GEL-Nimbus 16 is a tremendous shoe for everyone. The Asics GEL-Nimbus brand has always had a reputation for quality running shoes. One of the newest models, GEL- Nimbus 16 still has the impressive durability and comfortably. Shoes are important in running. Two-thirds of active runners suffer from injuries each year, so it is important to choose the right pair of shoes to run in.It is more enjoyable running with shoes that are comfortable, rather than running in light weight shoes but dont provide comfort to your feet. Comfort is what you expect from Asics shoes, and this model is no different. Whether you have wide or narrow feet, with Asics GEL-Nimbus 16s Heel Clutching System?, the padding is snug with your heel to feel secure, but not tight. Even for runners with custom arch supports, Asics GEL-Nimbus shoes make custom insoles feel comfortable. The custom arches feel as if they came with the shoe unlike other running shoe brands where custom insoles feel clunky and uneven with the shoe style.What is new, when it comes to durability, is the new Guidance Trusstic System?. This makes the midsole more structurally durability. It makes this shoe sturdier after long runs on concrete unlike past Asics GEL-Nimbus shoes that would wear out more quickly.The price for GEL-Nimbus 16 is around $100, which is cheaper than other Asics brands. GEL-Kayano is another high quality Asics brand and is $30 more, but doesnt provide more comfortable than the Nimbus. You can save yourself some money by passing the Kayano for the Nimbus.The only difference between the GEL-Nimbus 16 and the GEL-Nimbus 15 is there is less padding right by the top of the shoelaces. The tongue is wider than previous models and makes is less fitted when the shoelaces are tide. That is the only feature that I was displeased with but does not change my overall satisfaction. The Asics GEL-Nimbus 16 is worth the high price for the amount of comfort and durability any type of runner wants in a good pair of running shoes.",Great Running Shoes
B00ES82H6K,"February 25, 2015",5,9.5,4E, Titanium/Black/Red,"I have been running 2 marathons a year since 2011 and had worn various running shoes before first trying the Gel-Nimbus 13.  Since wearing them on my third marathon, I have never gone back to anything else.  These shoes are perfectly comfortable and offer great support.  These have been the only shoes I have worn that I did not get foot blisters after completing the 20+ mile training runs as well as the marathons.  Getting at least two pairs of these shoes allows you to switch with every run, allowing the material to spring back or dry if you had been sweating heavily, and extends the life and comfort of them.  Of course, everyone's feet are different, but I will be a Gel-Nimbus wearer for the rest of my running life!",Preparing for my 9th Marathon
B00ES82H6K,"May 25, 2015",2,14,4E, Titanium/Black/Red,"This is the third pair of Nimbus gels I've owned. The first two were phenomenal but this last pair turned into a nightmarish blister inducing hell. I worked on breaking these in like I normally do with running shoes. Start with some short walks and runs for a few weeks rotating them into and out of my line up and then eventually switching over to running them full time. For the first 2 months they were fine no blisters but recently every time I've worn then they've caused blisters in multiple different spots. I've tried different lacing techniques, different sock configurations and so on. I've also only used synthetic socks exclusively, but still... blisters every time I wear them. Maybe I got a bad pair.Today I decided that I would retire these shoes to just walking since I've never had blister issues with them from walking. Welp that was no good because now I have a completely new blister right in the middle of my foot (never had one there before). After my walk today I was going to set these shoe on fire in our backyard but then realized they would probably stink up the whole neighborhood so I decided to just toss them in the trash. I guess it's time to find a new shoe... :(",Nightmarish Blister Inducing Hell
B00ES82H6K,"April 6, 2015",4,11,D(M), Island Blue / Lightning / Lime,"I must say this is one of if not the best running shoe I have owned . What I noticed within 2 days of my 3 miles a day on the beach , was my back no longer had the annoying little pains during or after my run . Only reason I'm not giving a 5 is because I take 2e width but was not available so I settled for 14 4e which is slightly looser fitting, if I want to wear thicker socks I can do it with no problems.I like the  shoe so much I ordered a second pair so I can switch off every other day to keep them fresh  for my workouts . It truly is almost like walking / running on a cloud ( if that was possible ) .It's hard for me to find shoes that fit my feet width wise without paying a ridiculous price for them . So I am very happy to find these are available at  a reasonable price for an outstanding shoe . All of my Reebox, Nike , Skechers are just taking up room in my closet now , they are all good shoes but don't quite compare to my Asics-gels .

B00ES82H6K,"October 3, 2014",2,9.5,2E, White/Black/Royal,"I made the mistake of buying these shoes online. The right shoe is fine. However, the left shoe has a poorly glued inside seam, near where the tongue attaches. That lets a flap of mesh fabric fold over and move around, acting like sandpaper. The first time I wore them I walked three miles and ran two miles and the skin was rubbed raw on top of one of my toes. I thought at first it was because they weren't broken in, but then I found the problem. I stuck a piece of duct tape in there to cover the flap, but I've been wearing my Brooks until my toe heals so I don't know if the tape ""fix"" will work or not. I've owned three pair of Asics running shoes counting these. Two of the three pair were defective in some way. This is inexcuseable in a shoe of this price. I'll stick with Brooks from now on, although both brands are made in China so I wouldn't be surprised if quality issues show up with them too at some point.
