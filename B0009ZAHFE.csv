B0009ZAHFE,26-Jun-16,4,7.5,M,Black,"I had a pair of these shoes when I was on the dance team in high school, I loved them. I decided to order these for when I take my zumba/Mixxedfit classes that are an hour long. These are great if you do strictly dance or zumba, but my mixxedfit classes are more hip hop and boot camp based, with a lot of squats in songs and moves where i needed my feet to be flat for comfort. I wore these twice to give it a good shot and my feet were killing me a half hour in. Otherwise these are the best shoes out there for your dancing purposes. You are able to do your turns and spins without sticking to the floor, but with a ton of support so your not falling. I wish these would have worked out but I ended up giving them away and buying high top sneakers!",Great for dance
B0009ZAHFE,9-Jan-17,5,11.5,M,Black,"Awesome dance shoes!  I was doing Zumba wearing minamilistic shoes, but there wasn't enough support for my 60 year old knees.  I tried running shoes, but they gripped too much.  These shoes give me support and the ability to turn and spin.  They are not pretty, rather utilitarian, and they do run a whole size small.  I normally wear a 101/2, and in these I wear a 11 1/2.",Great Shoes
B0009ZAHFE,6-Oct-15,5,10.5,M,White,"I've only ordered online shoes once .They were so uncomfortable I returned them.  I really didn't have high expectations with these Fierce shoes but decided to go for it anyway.  I could return them, right?  Well, was I surprised!. I wear a Women's size 10 and ordered size 10.5.  I laced them up and wow!  Snug but not tight.  The heels don't rub at all.  I can wiggle my toes. The soles spin beautifully.  While there is no arch support, it has front and heel hard sole.  When laced up, it is  very snug and feels like support.  The soles are hard material and I am able to spin with no problem. I am very happy with them.",The soles spin beautifully for line dance
B0009ZAHFE,16-May-15,5,8.5,M,Red,"I bought the Capezio Women's DS11 Fierce Dance Sneaker about a month ago to wear for line dancing and I'm so glad I did!  My knees hardly ever hurt like they used to when I danced in my cowboy boots.  My feet still hurt after a couple of hours of dancing but that might be something to be expected regardless of the shoe, I'm not sure.The sizing seems odd to me though. Normally I wear a 7 or 7-1/2, and after a bit of trial and error it ended up that size 8-1/2 worked for me so please be aware that you probably won't be able to fit into them if you order your regular street shoe size. I recommend that you make sure the seller allows returns and order two pairs - one being a size larger than usual and the other 1-1/2 sizes larger - and then return the one that doesn't fit as well.",Great for line dancing!
B0009ZAHFE,23-Mar-14,5,7,M,White,"My regular Zumba class is on indoor/outdoor carpeting which is terrible for the knees but these work exceptionally well when sliding and pivoting.  I wore them to get licensed to teach Zumba and found that in a real Zumba studio with polished hardwood floors they were scary slippery.  With practice I'm sure they would have been fine but the lack of friction that I am so used to made me overcompensate everything to the point of sliding when just trying to stand still.  This is my second pair of Capezios, the first were black and I wore them outside going to and from the gym and eventually they became scuffed enough on the soles that it created friction and had to be replaced, also, the seams were coming undone but this was after wearing them 2-3 times a week for three years. I purchased white this last time to show up better under the black lights when I teach and people are trying to figure out the footwork.  Both pairs I ordered are half-size larger than I normally wear and that makes them fit well with the thin socks I use.  I babied these ones for about a month before I decided I had better things to do so I throw these in the washer and let them air dry when they become yellow with sweat.  It's been several months now and only the laces are showing sings of wear.  I highly recommend them.",Zumba Wear FTW
B0009ZAHFE,21-Nov-16,1,7,M,Black,"The shoes were too small even though I ordered a half size larger than what I normally wear for dance/exercise shoes.  The toe box is also too narrow for me even it the shoes were another size larger.  They then would be long enough but still pinch my toes.I did like the other qualities of the shoe, and for someone with narrow feet, especially the toe area, I am sure would like the shoe.",I did like the other qualities of the shoe
B0009ZAHFE,28-Oct-14,4,8,M,Black,"Normally I order a 7.5 for Capezios, even though I'm a size 7.  I had to return the 7.5 and get the size 8.  If you can find a store nearby to go try them on, I highly recommend that, then come back and order through amazon.  They are comfortable and so far are holding up a bit better than the other style I had, which fell apart in no time.  I find these a bit more chunky than I would like, but they give good support, have a good heel and comfortable toe box.  I don't know if it's the shoe, but they seem to get sticky on the bottom even when dry.  The other style only did this if I stepped in something, these seem to start to stick after about 3 hours of dancing.  That's a bummer because then my legs get tired from too much work.  Price is good.",A Little Clunky But Good...
B0009ZAHFE,24-Jan-13,5,9,M,Black,"I take Zumba classes almost daily and because I tend to have extremely flexible feet, not all sneakers work for me and I find I need to take excessive breaks during my workout due to uncomfortable shoes and/or numbing toes.  After trying most tried and proven workout sneakers, I spotted someone in my class with similar issues wearing a dance/hip hop shoe like this one where the piece in the middle is flexible.  I came across this shoe on your website and immediately ordered them.  Not only was it made by a trusted company, but the price was amazing and not bad on the eyes!I have already used them many times and there was no need to break them in at all.  I am totally impressed with the performance of this shoe.  I didn't have to take any breaks during my routine and found I was able to pull off all of the Zumba moves with great ease and speed which is something I find difficult to do with a sneaker.I usually take between an 8 and 8.5 in woman's shoe depending on the material and quality of the shoe so I went ahead and ordered a 9 in this shoe and it fit perfectly!  I like that it came with an extra pair of shoe laces in gray which allowed me to change my look.  Would definitely recommend this shoe to anyone who has similar issues and enjoy a dance routine as a workout.  It doesn't disappoint and as a matter of fact, I'm thinking of buying an extra pair so that I never have to go without.  Although the shoe itself looks and feels quite durable and can take a beating.Vickie from NJ",Great Zumba Shoe!
B0009ZAHFE,20-Feb-17,4,9,M,Black,"I have a pair of these same Capezio DS11 dance sneakers from two years ago that I love for Zumba classes.  I ordered new ones as my others have gotten worn out, but found that the new ones are a bit tight in the big toe area.  I typically wear a size 8.5 in all other shoes and had already sized up to a 9 for these (as I had worn last time as well), but will need to return for a size 9.5.  I would have given my old pair five stars, but am giving these just four stars because I am concerned that when I receive my replacement sneakers in size 9.5 so that my toes won't rub, the heel may be loose.",Too Small in Big Toe Area - Need half size larger than last pair (full size larger than typical shoe size)

B0009ZAHFE,23-Jun-14,4,9.5,M,Black,"I've been wearing Capezio DS11 for the last 8 years for linedance & the last 2 years for zumba. One pair usually lasts me around 2 years,frequency of use is 4-5 times a week...sometimes as long as 4 hours per session. These shoes have kept my knees & feet in good shape for the last 8 years. Excellent cushioning on the ball & heel which really is important for dancing,especially zumba. In these shoes I could jump,bounce & do pivoting with ease. My knees & feet have been protected from any injury & damage with these shoes. I've been wearing 9.5 all these years & I don't wear other brands besides Capezio. So recently,I ordered this pair again in my 9.5 since my current shoes although still in good condition are starting to show their age,been 2 years already. Imagine my disappointment when I received the shoes. A 9.5 couldn't fit me anymore! The width of the shoe is now way much narrower than my old pair. I forced my feet in but really just couldn't fit anymore. Sadly,I had to sell the shoes to a friend whose size fits. Putting side by side the old & new pair to compare, the difference in the cut is pretty obvious. The new pair cuts very narrow. I don't understand why Capezio now makes such narrow cut for its shoes. It was doing great with the old design for umpteen years. Many loyal Capezioians among my friends. In fact,as recent as last week,4 of my zumba friends bought this exact design upon my recommendation after going to a local shop to try the fit of the shoes. I would still recommend this DS11 for people wanting solid cushioning in their shoes for dance & Zumba but you must make sure you go to a local shop to try on the various sizes to see your best fit then order from Amazon. Don't just buy base solely on reviews here. I tried my friend's 10.5 & the fit was ok but somehow because of the narrow width the shoes didn't feel as great as before. So I won't be buying them for myself anymore. Capezio,please take heed.",Was my favourite dance sneakers

I have used a variety of dance sneakers (for Zumba and other dance classes), and these are by far my favorite - lightweight, good pivot surface (your knees will thank you!), good fit, and relatively good support. I do use these in combination with Spenco for her Total Support II insoles to get a bit more lateral stability and prevent injuries since the classes I attend tend to be high energy and involve a lot of jumping. My only complaint about these shoes is that they do not last very long - seem connecting the shoe to the outer sole ripped after only a few short months' use, but are still wearable. Pretty good price too, I just do wish the quality was a little better.",Awesome for Zumba
B0009ZAHFE,16-Apr-13,5,12,M,Black/Red,"Love these shoes - they are allowing me to pursue Zumba and belly dance without having to get a total knee replacement. And I have a white pair for work as well - I am a nurse and deal with surgical patients so there is a lot of twisting and turning involved in my job. These dance sneakers keep me from torquing my knee in all of those situations as well, and help me be the 1st one there whenever the emergency call bell goes off. I do have a history of a false high arch - meaning it is actually flat when I stand up. Plus I've had a Morton's neuroma cut on my right foot. These shoes support my arch, despite the split last, and the toe box allows the splaying that occurs, in my forefoot with each downstep, since the surgery. Hence, duh, 5 stars!",Don't do Zumba without them

So that is what i did. The 8.5 size was a little snug and touching my big toes. I might have been able to stretch it out but I didn't want to go through the pain. I kept the 9s and sent back the 8.5 size. Thank you for making returns so easy.The shoes are perfect for my folk dancing and they are the first pair of dance shoes I have bought for my class.

B0009ZAHFE,3-Apr-15,4,7.5,M,White,"I like these shoes.  They are light, have split soles but offer arch support.  They also have higher heels than any other dance sneakers I've own including Bloch etc. , means more impact cushion, but less lateral stability, may not suit all people.  Like most dance sneakers they take a little getting use to, have smoother soles that offer less friction for pivoting, kind to knees, but which mean slippery.  The seams of the inside arch of feet tends to fray from the lacing, especially if you like a snug fit.  If only they re-enforce the seams, I would give it a 5, they would last longer.

B0009ZAHFE,3-Jan-13,4,13,M,Black,"I have only tried these shoes one time for Zumba dancing so far.  I really like the snug fit and the way you can really tighten the laces all the way down the shoe.  They are a fabric shoe, so they have a lot of give and good ventilation for your feet.  I like the flat toe which makes it easy to break over when dancing.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is that it's a bit too slick right now.  They just refinished the gym floors so that might be contributing to the problem but when I do moves where you slid your feet apart, they don't grip good to stop.  However, I think when I use them a few more times they will scuff up and be just fine.

I ordered a size up, following the other reviewer's advice and it's been great. Generally, I wear fitness socks with these. If I were wearing nylons or tights, this would be on the roomier side of things, but because I'm using them for zumba, the thickness of the socks works fine. As far as wear and tear - I've been using these for a few month with almost daily use and they're holding up great. For someone who has never used jazz sneakers, this is going to be an adjustment. The hard plastic on the sole makes it very easy to pivot so you don't accidentally over-twist your knee, but the trade-off is you have to have enough balance to not overshoot your pivot into a complete turn.",Love it

Amazon and this pair were by far the best quality for the best price! I would definitely recommend them for any type of dance class from jazz technique to Zumba at the gym.

B0009ZAHFE,25-Sep-12,3,8,M,Black,"I have been a dancer for years and own a pair of Capezio canvas dansneakers as well as a pair of Sansha ""Skazz"" dance sneakers.  I wrongly assumed that since the ""Fierce"" were from Capezio, that their sizing and width would be consistent.  Not.  These will have to be returned.Unfortunately, these shoes are a huge disappointment.  They are far too narrow! I could barely get these shoes on and going up another half size will not help (know from experience).I will order a new pair of Sanshas (sold here on Amazon). Down side with the Sansha (perhaps all practice dance shoes) is that padding wears out fairly quickly. If you are new to wearing dance sneakers, remember to replace them when the padding breaks down and that can be as early as four to five months.  The exterior of the shoe can and will often look ""perfect"".  Replace your shoes once you start having foot or calf discomfort.",Width-----too narrow!

B0009ZAHFE,7-May-11,4,9.5,M,Black,"Not having ordered Capezio shoes in a while, I ""averaged"" all of the previous comments size adjustments and went with one whole size up.  For me, that was about right... I use these for teaching dance and for taking classes myself and they should be more snug than street shoes so that you can really be in control (if they're too big, for example, it will be harder to point your toes).  If I had gone up 1.5 sizes they would have been too big.As for the shoe itself, the turning spot on the sole is better than some of the other dance sneakers out there (it is easy to turn) but Capezio has made a good compromise and made sure that the shoes aren't TOO slippery on wooden floors, for instance.  They are comfortable and feel like they will last - the only thing that is strange about them is how tightly the shoe hugs the foot between the arch and ball of the foot (it almost feels as if the arch of the shoe hits too far forward).","Good dance shoe, reasonable price"

The toe box has plenty of room and the heel does fits snugly.  My feet don't feel quite as sweaty in the shoes as they're very breathable mesh.  The arch is unusual at first, but I've grown to like the feel after wearing them to class.One week of zumba in my new shoes: my knees and the arches of my feet feel much better.  I've been able to easily pivot and spin.  I feel I'm actually burning more calories now as I can move with abandon and the concern for tripping in my shoes is no longer a factor.Overall, I love these shoes!

I will say this though; since they're meant to slide on the floor, when you're doing core exercises or moves that don't require sliding, so be careful - you have to work a little more at staying still.  But even then, it's still good because you'll feel your inner and outer thighs toning up!  Anyway, the other reviews recommended upping the size and I totally agree.

After an hour of dancing, my feet don't hurt. I don't wear them on the street so as to preserve them, which I found is typical of the people in my classes. You will enjoy wearing them and your dancing should even improve (unless you were an expert to begin with - which I wasn't!).",Great for Zumba

Luckily Amazon has a great return policy so I was able to exchange them for the right size. For reference, my normal shoe size is 7.5, I initially ordered 8.5, but I ended up exchanging them for the correct fit of a 8.  My recommendation is that you only size up HALF a shoe size from your normal ""street shoe"" size.",Great shoe once I got the fit right.

Having a condition called plantar faciitis, I have NO pain at all while wearing these shoes.  I agree with the other reviews in that I had to order a size larger than my street shoe size.  I typically wear a size 8 in street shoes so I ordered a 9 in the dansneaker and I am glad I did so.  I use one pair for Zumba class and the other for street shoes as long as there is no snow on the ground.  Thank you, Capezio & Amazon!!",Fits better than Cinderella's shoe!

After reading the reviews about these dance shoes, I noticed someone else had the same problem after their Zumba workout and how these shoes made a difference.  I have noticed a BIG difference now after using these shoes.  They are flexible, comfortable and you can turn more easily then on regular workout shoes.  Another great piece of advice I read was to buy a size larger, which I did, and they fit nicely.  Love these shoes!",Great Zumba shoes!

Anyway, I took to consideration all the comments and ordered one size up and it works beautifully.  I wish it's a bit wide though but it does not cost a major inconvenience for me.  I used it for my Zumba classes and it is great.  I used to control my movements because the tennis shoes I used to wear sticks to the floor and any wrong move may injure my knees.  With this one, I still have to do a bit of controlling but it's more on slipping depending on the dance floor surface.  In my case, it's a shiny wood flooring.",Pretty happy with this shoes but yes take one size up...

Great price for them here on Amazon. The only reason I don't give five stars for these shoes is because they wear out quickly. But I love them. I've tried so many other shoes for Zumba, and these are the best for me. They do run small. Order up 1/2 - 1 size from your normal tennis shoe size.

The shoes are well made and have great support, but they are not a good fit for my feet, I bought one size larger, but I think I could have gone even larger.  I am giving them a good score even though they don't fit well because they have some of the best support I can find.  I used to love Reebok's but they are removing lots of support from their aerobic, zumba and cross fit shoes and my Achilles tendon is not very happy about it.  So if you get them big enough, and you do Zumba or similar type of exercise I think you will love them.","The shoes are well made and have great support, but they are not a good fit ..."

So, I ordered these little guys (and they are small, so order at least one size up!) and I've had no aches or pains since.  The shoe bends completely in the middle because of the split sole, which gives me flexibility and adds a little bounce to my step, I think.

B0009ZAHFE,24-Apr-14,2,9.5,M,Black,"Amendment to original review: As much as I love the fit of these shoes; as great as they are for line dancing; I will not buy another pair.  These shoes do not hold up well because of a flaw in the design.  Each pair I have owned has split in the same place - on the outside edge, just behind the front sole area.  There is another review that includes 3 pictures of exactly this problem.  The mesh pulls away from the vinyl.  If Capezio has a dance sneaker that is reinforced around the arch rather than from front to back, I might try it.Original review: This is my second pair of Capezio DS11 Fierce Dance Sneakers.  I bought the first pair from a local store because I didn't know any better.  I paid a lot more.  The upside was that I knew for sure that I needed a size larger than my normal size for this shoe to fit properly.  I did notice that the Amazon description makes note of this but I might not have believed it if I hadn't actually experienced it.  So, having firsthand experience enabled me to confidently order the correct size from Amazon and I am happy with the fit of these shoes.",My second pair
B0009ZAHFE,7-Mar-11,5,8,M,Black,I love these shoes. I go to ZUMBA and with these shoes it makes it alor easier. The sizing is how it is supposed to be. Get one size bigger than a normal shoe.

I found the shoe to have no arch support, and they felt very wide even with a thick sock.  I tried to dance in these shoes, and it felt as though I was wearing the box the shoe came in because the shoe was so large and I felt clumsy in them.  There is a huge amount of padding in the shoe, so that is why they warn you to order a size up.  They may be o.k. for a zumba class, but they were horrible for ballroom practice shoes.  I returned them.",but they were horrible for ballroom practice shoes

But, I wore them once and found them to be way too slippery on the floor the class is held on (polished wood gym floor).  While it is easy to slide and pivot, lunges and squats are impossible to hold and control. The workout aspect is more important to me than danceability so I went back to wearing my running shoes to class. There is another woman in the class who wears the Capezio Fierce and likes them, so I will try to wear them again to see if I can adapt.  Maybe there is a way to scuff up the bottoms a bit.  That aside, the shoes are well made and were affordable. For just dancing, they'd be great.",My Opinion

I'm a size 9 and bought a 10 based on reviews and it's a bit too big so a 1/2 up would have been better.  Also, (sorry, this is hard to explain) the first time I slipped my heel into the untied left shoe, it pushed the padding that would be cupping the heel/achilles tendon down, within the fabric, and it folded in half.  I can't get it back up so there is a lumpy part at the back of my foot.  I already had danced in them so didn't feel I could return them plus I didn't feel like paying for return shipping so I'm keeping it, but caution others to make sure they hold the back of the shoe firmly, so the foam padding doesn't slide out of place.  I think I have to cut into the fabric to ""massage"" the padding back in place.

I had noticed some of the ""seasoned"" ladies had these on and they told me to go to a dance studio to purchase them. I have had the ballet dance shoes and those hurt my feet as well, no support. I used these and THEY MADE A DIFFERENCE. I was able to complete the entire zumba dance class with ease and able to get the full work that Zumba was made for, I would not go back to tennis shoes for any reason for any dance class.",AWESOME PAIR OF DANCE SHOES

B0009ZAHFE,21-Aug-10,2,10,M,Black,I bought these for doing zumba dance classes.  They seem like a good shoe but run very small.  had a hard time getting the right fit.  Definitely order a size up.,dance sneakers
B0009ZAHFE,19-Jul-13,5,8,M,Black,"I don't know why Amazon lists this as a Woman's dance sneaker because they look unisex. I bought mine in a local store a little over a year ago and I'm very pleased with it's performance. I dance mostly Salsa, Bachata and Samba de Gafieira.MaintenanceBefore those I only had dance shoes with suede bottoms which required me to brush them constantly. Dance floors for classes and socials in my region are either dusty or plain bar like dirty with drink spills and the suede bottoms acquire a lot of debris. My suede bottom shoes would require me to brush them all the time and the sole would peel off, so I had to repair them constantly with shoe goo or barge cement. These sneakers have plastic bottoms and they don't collect any debris from the messy dance floors I dance on. I wore those dance shoes at least 4 days of the week since I bought them and I danced between 10 to 18 hours a week on them between classes and socials and I only had to do minor repairs on it once. They look worn out after all this beating, but they still function just like when I bought them.Turns and spinsIf you are used to suede bottoms as I was when I first wore those shoes, you will feel a difference. The plastic bottoms will give me just enough grip on a hardwood dance floor so I can still turn and spin without damaging my knees. The grip was not the same as the suede bottoms, so it took me about two weeks to get the same control I had on my suede bottom shoes. But I am not a big fan of spinning, so I don't go farther than a 720 turn myself and I don't do those often.Hardwood and ideal dance floorsThose are my favorite dance floors and I am very happy wearing my dance sneakers to dance on those. I had enough grip to not slide around as it would happen with slick leather bottom shoes or suede bottom shoes when they collect too much dust. They will not give me too much resistance, like street shoes.Polished concrete bar floors and other slow floorsThose dance floors were usually a nightmare for me. Dancing at a bar can completely ruin a pair of good dance shoes because of all the drink spills and all the junk that stays on the floor. I even bought a pair of shoes at the Salvation Army and put some slick leather on its bottoms myself to go to those places. At some point I decided to give it a chance to my dance sneakers and they did just fine. It is still sticky as hell, I have to pick up my feet to not damage my knees and spins are not in the menu, but they did not collect all the junk from the dance floor and did not get stickier throughout the night.Looks and comfortThey are sneakers and look like sneakers, which to me it means they don't look as nice as leather shoes. I wish they made shoes with the same qualities as this product. They are quite good at giving your feet some ventilation, but they get hotter than shoes. I would not recommend wearing those sneakers with thick socks.SizingManufacturer's website says you may want to add 1/2 because they are well padded (and they are) and add 2 more if you are a man. Another dance supply website recommends adding a full size over your street shoes for women and 2 1/2 for men. Mine were quite tight when I bought them, but they have loosen up a bit. I'd say they 2 1/2 for men is about right if you wear thicker socks.OverallI am very pleased with this product and I was looking for a new pair because my current ones look worn out. They are still great for classes and practices, but I wanted a new one looking nicer for special occasions.",The longest lasting dance shoes I had so far
B0009ZAHFE,6-Jun-12,3,7.5,M,Black,"UPDATE: I sent the defective shoes back to Capezio and they replaced them, no charge.  So, I bumped them up from 1 star to 3 for their excellent customer service.  If these shoes do better than the last, I'll give them 5 stars.  I do like the Capezio fit better than the Bloch... the Bloch don't seem to stay on my heel as well.I love Zumba and Latin dance.  These shoes are great for both; they have just the right amount of slide for turns without hurting your ankles when on linoleum or wood floors. (Some waxes and mat cleaning solutions can make the floors slippery, but as a rule, they are great.)  I ALWAYS change shoes when I get in the studio, and have occasionally worn them into clubs, as they are comfortable, black and always in my car. (I'm a student.)Unfortunately, I bought these last Fall and in May they are tearing between the uppers and the molded sole.  An inside loop for the shoe lace broke first.  I think these failures are premature for a shoe designed for these applications. Due to a sprained foot, I'd only actually used them for 5 months, so because of their short life I demoted them from 5-stars to only 1-star. I can no longer recommend them to anyone.Size-wise, you should probably buy these in a real store where you can try them on.  I wear a Men's 9 in my regular shoes.  I tried both the ""12 M"" and the ""13 M"" shoes.  The 12s seemed tight, so I got the 13s.  Once in the studio, I realized that the ""turning ball"" on the sole didn't align with the ball on my foot.  So, I exchanged them for the 12.. and they fit like a glove..  like an OJ Simpson glove.  Snug, but good.","Comfortable, but didn't last - Zumba"
B0009ZAHFE,10-Feb-16,3,6,M,Black,"I wore the shoes for 3 hrs. straight right after I received them. they wore in good and comfortable on my feet.2 things I notice is - 1-on the right foot shoe the shoe string strap are not even with the other side strap, like off 1/2"", which makes the shoe a little deformed looking, which I'm unhappy about.  And the shoe strings are way, way to long about 12"" to long. I would return the pair of shoe for its defect and order another pair if I didn't have to pay for a delivery fee.",they wore in good and comfortable on my feet
B0009ZAHFE,2-Dec-16,5,8,M,Black,"This I my 2nd purchase of theses great shoes.I wore the 1st pair out after 1year.Now wearing the new ones.There great, comfy , very flexible , lite.Need to by 1/2 size larger when purchasing..Highly recommend.",Great Zumba shoe .

B0009ZAHFE,10-May-13,5,10.5,M,Black/Red,"I never write a review but this shoes is a dreamIt makes you feel no jumps, feel no kick and feel you are dancing on air...I bought the z kick than the bloch and now this and truth be told that this is the boss of them all.I went 1 size up and it fit pefect and wore it 6 times to zumba and love it..",comfy zumba shoes
B0009ZAHFE,15-Oct-10,2,10,M,Red,"I wore these in one Zumba class and they were very uncomfortable and ended up hurting my feet. I do feel that you should just get 1/2 size larger than your normal street shoe, though. I wear a size 9 and got a 10 due to the reviews. Though these fit, I think they should fit a little more snug; for Zumba, anyway. You don't want your foot moving around in the shoe. They seemed a little clunky to me too. Kind of like I was wearing a man's shoe. I returned them and got a pair of Capezio Women's Web Dansneaker; and I love them!!",Used these for a Zumba class

B0009ZAHFE,2-Mar-11,5,9.5,M,Black,Just wore these shoes for Zumba class for the first time tonight and could really tell a huge difference in how my knees felt after class.  The low tread on these sneakers makes the dance steps much smoother...no "gripping" on the floor!  Well worth the price.  I ordered a full size larger than my "street shoe" size and they fit perfectly with socks.  Two big thumbs up for these shoes!,Love these!
B0009ZAHFE,15-Jun-09,2,9.5,M,Red,"I bought two different brands of these shoes, the Capezios, through Amazon, are really hard and not comfortable at all. I bought them one and a half size larger than my regular street shoes, and they still felt tiny. I had to return them, doing that I lost the S&H fees, about 10 bucks, but customer service at the store (Second Skin Shoes) was excellent, they were very fast and very nice. I would definitely buy from them again, but not this specific pair shoes. I ended up getting Bloch dance shoes that fit perfect!",Shoes aren't good but customer service is great!
B0009ZAHFE,28-Oct-14,3,12.5,M,White,"My regular shoe size is 9, and I bought 9.5, but it was still tight with very thin socks. Shoe seem good in everyway other than the fit. I just tried on one time.",It doesn't fit
B0009ZAHFE,2-Jan-14,5,9.5,M,Black,"My wife works in the medical profession, and these shoes fit the requirements, and are very comfortable to boot! She wants me to note the product so that when she wears these out I can get her new ones.",Nice Shoe
B0009ZAHFE,6-Oct-12,5,9,M,Red,"These are comfortable with good arch support. They are lightweight and flexible and make my zumba work out more fun. Definitely worth it.

B0009ZAHFE,29-Mar-10,4,7.5,M,Black,"I bought these shoes for zumba class 4-5x per week.  After reading the reviews, I bought a size 7.5 (I ususally wear a 6.5 or 7) and they fit perfectly.  I have still not yet decided if they have enough cushioning for the high impact parts of class but they slide well.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase.",Pretty Good
B0009ZAHFE,20-Jun-12,5,8.5,M,Black,"Fast shipping, and a great product!  They are already helping me in my dance practice tremendously.  Great fit with the tip to order one size larger than normal shoe size.",Love them!
B0009ZAHFE,27-Nov-11,2,6.5,M,Red,I ordered these shoes 2x. I wear an 8. I ordered an 8.5 - too small. Then a 9- still too small! Had to pay return shipping on both and restocking fee. I still dont have shoes that I can wear.,Sizing is an issue with these shoes....

I have to order another pair, impossible to return ( I live outside the US). Be aware!! Otherwise, they seem quite comfortable and they don't get stuck on the floor, they slide.",awfully small!!!!
